# Getting Started

![Zapper API](../../static/img/assets/zapper_api_logo.png)

The Zapper API provides some of the most robust Web3-related data, 
from complex DeFi app balances to NFT valuations and  pool liquidity and prices on different AMMs, all in
one convenient place. 

:::info 
We ask that builders who are using our API for free include our **"Powered by Zapper"**
logo with a back-link to [https://zapper.xyz](https://zapper.xyz) in their project.
**"Powered by Zapper"** brand asset can be downloaded
[here](../docs/brand-assets.md)
